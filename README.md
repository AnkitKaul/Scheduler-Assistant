- EJS is way faster than most of the technologies out there
- Simple template tags: <% %>
- EJS has a really smart error handling mechanism built right into it


**2) Back End: Node.js** 
- Highly Flexible in terms of change in code
- Has the ability to scale up quickly and efficiently
- More familiar to me and easy for new Developers
- A really wide active user community

## Future Scope:
- Improving the Front End part with ReactJS or AngularJS framework to reduce the size of the code and the burden to read the entire code
- Using Machine Learning Models to recommend students about the courses they can opt for next semester based on their previous courses
- Increasing the scope of the project to Institute Level or College Level
